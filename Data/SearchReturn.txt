			"description": "WhatsApp Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for iPhone and other smartphones. WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, and Voice Messages. \n\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:  \n\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\n\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, and Voice Messages. \n\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp). \n\n• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.\n\n• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.* \n\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book. \n\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out. \n\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \nWe're always excited to hear from you! If you have feedback, questions, or concerns, please email us at: \niphone-support@whatsapp.com \n\nor follow us on twitter: \n\nhttp://twitter.com/WhatsApp\n@WhatsApp\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: WhatsApp is a telephony app, so iPod and iPad are not supported devices.",

			"description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. Over 100 million active users in two and a half years.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.\n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 30,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOC, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, Telegram is lean and easy to use.\n\n100% FREE & NO ADS: Telegram is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees. \n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

GPS support is only available on Series 2 and 3 Apple Watches.\n\nTRACKS AND STORES ALL YOUR RUNS AND RECORDS\nGet all the detail you need—pace, distance, GPS route, elevation, heart rate, and mile splits. Real-time audio feedback will keep you on track during your run.\n\nAUDIO GUIDED RUNNING WORKOUTS WITH NIKE COACHES AND ATHLETES\nGet guidance, motivation and inspiration directly through in-ear audio from Nike’s coaches as well as elite athletes like Mo Farah and entertainers such as Kevin Hart. The workouts are designed to help runners improve strength, speed and endurance and have fun doing it.

One that starts with your goals and fitness level, and adapts as you progress.\n\nTROPHIES AND BADGES TO CELEBRATE YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS\nGet motivated and earn trophies when you smash Personal Records like your fastest 5K or longest run. Challenge yourself to earn monthly milestone badges or see how long you can keep your running streak alive.\n\nLEADERBOARDS LET YOU COMPARE AND COMPETE\nEasily compare and compete with friends and fellow runners on the distance leaderboard\n\nIN-RUN CHEERS FROM FRIENDS\nA little support can go a long way. You can receive motivating in-run audio cheers from friends during your run to keep you going strong. And if you want to cheer your friends back, that’s cool, too. \n\nCUSTOMIZABLE POST-RUN SHARING WITH FRIENDS\nPersonalize your activity posts by adding photos, stats and stickers, then customize who sees it—your other social networks, or just your Nike friends.\n\n\nThis app includes Nike stickers you can use in the app and on iMessage to share with friends. You can find the iMessage stickers in the iMessage app store by searching for NRC. By downloading the app, you agree that Nike provides these stickers for you to use only for that purpose. Nike may revoke this permission at any time.\n\nNike Run Club integrates with the Apple Health app to sync your workouts and record heart-rate data.\n\nPlease note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.",

			"description": "The best interval timer app for IOS just got even better! Downloaded by over 100,000 awesome people just like you, Intensity is the workout companion you’ve been looking for.  \n\n*** Now with Siri integration all new for iOS 11 ***\n\nBefore we tell you more, have a look at what people are saying:\n\n“This makes HIIT effortless. You don't have to think about what songs to play or how many intervals you have done, it does it all for you.\n\n“I downloaded this app to help with home tabata workouts and it is just what I was looking for. I love having my own playlist to keep me going through a tough workout!”\n\n“What more could you want then your own personal music & timers to keep you moving!”\n\nYou love HIIT because it’s a quick workout style that you can easily fit into your daily routine. We agree, and would hate to see you squandering your valuable time screwing around with a lame, hard to use timer app. That’s why we built a workout timer so easy to use, even your technology-challenged family member of choice would adore it.\n\nDownload and get started in seconds with built-in curated workouts. Go deeper with the flexibility of the best workout builder on the app store, adding your own custom intervals, rests, warm-up/cool-down,  caloric burn, and music selection. Speaking of music, have it your way with tunes from your own music library or use music from other apps, Intensity runs in the background so you can continue your routine even while using other apps or putting your device to sleep. Subtle sound queues and text-to-speech interval  announcements will guide you through each workout. And of course, we know how important it is for you to make progress towards your fitness goals, so we’ve added a workout log as well as easy integration with the iOS health app.\n\nIntensity - Your workouts, your way. ",

For example, if you lose your connection in the metro, you can continue reading your messages and reply to them. When you’re back online, those messages will be automatically sent.\n• The app supports using several inboxes at the same time, including Yandex.Mail for domains. You can read all your messages on one device by switching between profiles.\n• It’s easy to sort through your messages, even if there are a lot of them. Delete the ones you don’t want with one swipe, while the messages you need can be found through filters (for example, all your e-tickets or social network notifications).\n• Messages and chain letters which are grouped together by subject will open up right within the inbox message list.\n• Your files from Yandex.Disk can also be attached to your messages, not just documents and photos on your smartphone.\n• After receiving a message with an attachment, you’ll immediately know what’s inside. For instance, if it’s an image, then you’ll see a small thumbnail of it appear next to the subject line of the message in the inbox.\nIf you want to find answers to frequently asked questions, leave feedback about the app, or offer some new ideas, you can do so in the Settings and tapping on Support.",

			"description": "Welcome to the world of Augmented Reality (AR), which is more powerful now thanks to Apple's AR support. Meet our virtual trainer and your avatar. With the help of AR, they can appear at your place whenever you need them. Whether you’re planning your workout or working out somewhere, they will come handy. Set the avatar to represent your gender, height and body fat percentage. After you log a workout, all the muscles you trained will appear on your avatar. And the more you train during the week, the less rested muscles you'll have. The app will show you which muscles are ready for training. Use the virtual trainer, our model, to check how to properly do fitness exercises and to see which muscles you’ll use while exercising. \n\nPersonalize your AR experience and interact with the model: \n- Change your perspective to watch her/him from any angle. You don't have to move, unless you want to. \n- Resize her/him. They start with a realistic height, but you can increase or decrease it. \n- Relocate her/him on the screen. \n- Take photos and create videos of the AR—you can even stand or exercise right beside the model. \n\nGymaholic is the ultimate fitness app. You can use it with or without AR, or with or without an Apple Watch. Either way, the above-mentioned avatar and trainer are there for you on iPhone. The app for Apple Watch gives you the freedom to track your workout without your iPhone, in a way that no other app does. And the iPhone app is the best tool to help keep you on track. Both can effortlessly walk you through your training. It doesn't matter if you work out in a gym or at home. It integrates with the Health app. \n\nTrack any kind of workouts and sets: \n- Supersets, tri-sets, giant sets, drop sets, pyramid sets, fail sets \n- Bodybuilding, weightlifting, HIIT, cardio, bodyweight training, TRX \n\nWe work extra hard to provide you with the best features.

That person will receive an sms with instructions and a link to collect the money.\nIf the recipient is already a MoneyTalk user, he or she will receive a push notification about the transfer.\n\n2) Use card details, if you know those of your recipient.\nMoney transfers work for cards issued by any Russian bank in all regions.\nTo pay a minimum transfer fee, add details of a card that you will be using to receive or transfer money. \n\nYour bank card information is protected in compliance with the international security standards for payment services.\n\nFor additional security, you can create a password to access your payment details.\nOur app has been developed based on the official Telegram app (code: https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram).\n\nWe have just added our money transfer SDK.\nThis is what we have to offer:https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/MoneyTalk",

			"description": "Just choose WHAT to paint and HOW to paint it.\n\nFeed your art addiction. Find art. Merge it. \n\nSome are miracles. Some are weird\n\nRemixing is a talent. Can you find the magic?\n\n==\n\nGive the Pikazo AI a style—one of our readymades, an image on your camera roll, or a pic from the internet—and our AI painter uses it as inspiration to repaint your photos.\n\nYou'll start seeing styles everywhere. A cool t-shirt. A band poster. Street art. Latte art. \nStyles are everywhere, and only one snap anyway.\n\nChoose a subject by snapping a photo, picking one from your camera roll, or using our built-in web search. It it can be a selfie, a family photo, your favorite place or any image you can find.\n\n\nStart by using one of our hundreds of readymade high-resolution styles to get the hang of it. Then begin to explore with any other image you can find. Take a photo of art you see in the world, choose a texture from your camera roll, search for patterns on the Internet… the possibilities are endless.\n\nMake Art\n\nSubmit your choices and get a quick draft render to see if you like the combination. Audition a few different styles, and when you find one you like, enhance it to gorgeous high resolution.\n\nShare Your Creations\n\nBuild your portfolio of personal, production-quality artwork, then save and export the Pikazos you’ve made, share them on social media, post them to our salon for feedback, use them in your blog post or presentation, or even order a print. And with our inspirational MUSE section right in the app, you’ll never run out of ideas.\n\nREMEMBER ART CLASS?\n\nTables speckled with the bright drops of yellow, red, and blue paint that never made it to a student’s canvas. The faint smell of clay from misshapen forms left to dry on a shelf, waiting for the kiln. The feel of charcoal between finger and thumb, strangely warm and imprecise. \n\nWe believe that art is a universal birthright, and we created Pikazo to help you claim it. \n\nPikazo doesn’t care if you’re Bob Ross or can’t even doodle. Unlike oils or acrylics, the neural algorithms it uses obey an accountant or athlete as precisely as a master painter.\n\nPikazo in hand, the world is now yours. Make it art.\n\nMaybe you’re a professional artist now and you’re adding Pikazo images to a toolkit alongside brushes and turpentine.\n\nOr maybe the charcoal seemed to disobey you intentionally, you swore the paint preferred the table, and your sculpture was mistaken for discarded clay and never made it to the kiln. \n\nAnd maybe, ever since that art class, you’ve believed that art was something other people did - special, privileged people who could take anything in the world and magically make it art.\n\nJOIN THE ART WORLD, NO BERET NEEDED.\n\nAs a Pikazo artist, you are cordially invited to exhibit your work in the exclusive Salon, a gathering where like-minded creatives praise and critique each other’s art while, we assume, sipping espresso and wearing black.\n\nFRESH, PREMIUM STYLES EVERY WEEK.\n\nFrom the paintings of Pablo Picasso himself to the masonry of Angkor Wat, the world we see is packed with beautiful art that can be applied to any photo using Pikazo. Every week, we seek out the style images that deliver the most beautiful results and deliver them with a dose of creative inspiration. \n\nTO AN ARTIST, ART IS EVERYTHING. TO PIKAZO, EVERYTHING IS ART.\n\nPikazo is a collaboration between human, machine, and our concept of art. It is an experiment to see what emerges when anyone can create a masterpiece.\n\nIt is yoga for the brain. Brain for the yoga. For for the the. It is a universal art machine that paints any image in the style of any other, producing sometimes-beautiful, sometimes-disturbing, always-surprising artworks.\n\nWe encourage you to play. We can't wait to see what you make with it!",

For each metric you can setup conditional coloring and haptic alerts to help keep you in the zone.  You can even display graphs of your performance to help you understand how well your workout is going.\n\nYou can view detailed statistics for all of your past workouts (whether you've collected them in Workouts++ or not).  This includes summary statistics as well as graphs showing available minute-by-minute performance statistics.\n\nYour lifetime stats are also summarized to give you a better idea of what your past performance looks like and how/when you typically workout. \n\nYou can also listen to podcasts during your workout played directly from your Apple Watch.  Either transfer podcast files over to your Apple Watch before you head out or if you have a Series 3 LTE Apple Watch with cellular service you can stream the episodes right to your Apple Watch.\n\nNotes:\n • Workouts++ requires an Apple Watch to collect the data it displays\n • Workouts++ integrates with the Health App on your iPhone to retrieve the data it displays.  It will request permission to access the relevant data types associated with a workout.\n  • Streaming podcasts requires an Series 3 LTE Apple Watch and active cellular service.",

Check your voicemail. All without a bar of signal. As long as you’ve got Wi-Fi, TU Go keeps you connected. TU Go is available for O2 UK customers, Movistar customers in Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Mexico, and Vivo customers in Brazil. Movistar TU is available for customers in Colombia. \n\nTU Go lets you use your minutes and texts over Wi-Fi, on up to five devices. So next time your phone runs out of battery, you can’t find signal or you’re soaking up the sun abroad, don’t panic. You can still use the minutes and texts from your bundle.\n \nWho can use TU Go?\n- O2 UK Pay Monthly customers\n- O2 UK Business customers (excluding Mobex, some B4B and data only tariffs)\n- Movistar customers in Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Mexico\n- Vivo customers in Brazil\n \nThe best bits:\n \n• Stay in touch – choose between your mobile network, Wi-Fi or 3G/4G. And keep connected, wherever you are.\n \n• Travel friendly – use TU Go over Wi-Fi abroad and your minutes and texts will cost the same as they do in the UK.\n \nHere’s what some of our customers have to say about TU Go:\n \n“Thank you O2! The ability to call and text people while I'm on the London Underground with no signal is epic and has had a few people asking me questions on how it works!” – Imhama\n \n“I am currently traveling in South America so this app is saving me large amounts of money... Thanks O2 you are allowing me to keep in touch when I normally couldn't have afforded it…” – Rob Ericsson\n \n“I thought this sounded too good to be true, but it isn't! It does exactly what I want it to. In Wi-Fi only areas, I can make & receive calls, also texts. It works on my iPad as well! Which is more than could be said of WhatsApp!” - Chris_G_Devizes\n \nYou can get TU Go on iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch on iOS 7 and above later in Argentina, Peru and Colombia***.\n\nTo find out more:\nO2 UK Pay Monthly customers can visit http://o2.co.uk/tugo\nUK Business customers can visit http://o2.co.uk/business/tugo\nMovistar customers can visit http://tu.com/es/\n\nOr head to our blog: http://www.tu.com/en/blog\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTell us what you think of TU and how we can make it better.

			"description": "The Tuenti app is all you need to extend your powers of communication to infinity and beyond: you can enjoy extra minutes to make VozDigital calls, impossible and unlimited calls, conversations saved to listen to again, chat, and much more. And total control in the palm of your hand.*\n\n> EXTEND YOUR MINUTES\nThe Tuenti app adds VozDigital minutes to your combo FREE, so the only thing you spend when you use them is the time you're on the phone. What's more, they don't use the data from your combo even if you're on 3G/4G. They can be used to call national landline and cell phone numbers.\n\n> TALK WITHOUT LIMITS\nIf the person you're calling also has the Tuenti app, calls are unlimited! You won't spend VozDigital minutes or anything else.\n \n> IMPOSSIBLE CALLS: WITHOUT COVERAGE AND WITHOUT A CELL PHONE\nCalling without coverage and even without a cell phone seems impossible, but not with Tuenti. If you don't have coverage, connect to a WiFi network and use your cell phone to call normally. As your number and your phonebook are in the cloud, you can also do this from any other cell phone, computer or tablet, meaning that you won't miss any calls.\n \n> RELIVE YOUR CALLS AGAIN AND AGAIN\nSave your VozDigital calls to listen to them later as many times as you like. You can save calls simply by pressing a button while you're speaking. And the best thing is, it doesn't take up any space in your cell phone's memory as calls are saved in the app.\n\n> FORGET ROAMING\nIf you're traveling abroad, you can also call home without paying roaming charges. You can call via WiFi with your usual number without it costing you a penny more.\n\n> TOTAL CONTROL IN YOUR HAND\nWith the Tuenti app, you won't miss a single detail about your line: Check out your spending, top up, check your call history and messages, buy your combo and more. You can also ask us for help quickly and efficiently from the app: Write to us via chat anytime, anywhere, and we'll reply right away.\n\n> CHAT AND MUCH MORE\nYou can also use the app to chat, send SMS, customize your voicemail or choose how you prefer to let your contacts know your availability when they want to call or write to you.\n\n* The benefits listed here are available in some countries. Visit tuenti.pe, tuenti.com.ar, tuenti.ec or tuenti.mx for more information",

			"description": "Swingmail is a different and new approach to mail and contacts apps.  It brings you functionalities which help when you are on the go.\n\n1. Mail threaded by individual, group or topic.  The app selects what appear to be the most important mail threads and displays them in your Important view.  Of course you still have the view all, but you wil not need that anymore.\n2. Merge together contact entries and phone numbers of an individual or individuals who are related.  Swingmail then pulls all the relevant communication into a single thread for you.  Merging the phone numbers allows you to call out directly from a mail.\n3. Your mail is displayed in a chat format, which is becoming the new normal and makes replying easier and more natural.\n\nInstead of snoozing, deleting and archiving each individual mail, Swingmail proposes you silence contacts and select contacts who are important.  Customize Swingmail's Important Inbox and it will really become your go to personalized inbox for when you are out and about.\n\nWorks with:\niCloud, Gmail, Yahoo!, Outlook, Hotmail, KDDI EZWeb, Docomo and even Twitter Direct Messages.\n\nThe app has been featured in the US, Japan, Australia, NZ AppStore and has been written about in Techcrunch, Lifehacker and Venture Beat.\n\nMajor Features include:\n-Mail threaded by individuals, groups and topics.  Minimalist Inbox with only the information you need.\n-Merge email addresses and phone numbers of an individual or related individuals to get a single thread with all the communication.\n-Mute contacts to customize your inbox and contacts book to the appropriate size.\n-Get your Twitter Direct Messages in your inbox with other mail.\n-Your mail communication in the chat format that is best suited to mobile phones.\n-Proprietary algorithms prioritize contacts and communication for your important inbox.\n-Dial out of a mail using phone, Facetime or Audio Facetime.\n-Suggested list of contacts you need for a given time and place.\n-Automatic creation of contact groups that appear relevant based on event invitations, topics and frequency of common mailing.\n-Apple Watch enabled.\n\n*Users of versions older than version 4.0 will need to update and login again.  Apologies for the inconvenience.\n*Apple Watch OS 2.0 or later is necessary.\n*We look forward to hearing your feedback, opinions or suggestions.  \nFeel free to contact us on  support@swingmail.co",

			"description": "BBM® Enterprise is a secure mobile, cross-platform, messaging and collaboration tool. It provides the same user- friendly experience that’s earned BBM millions of fans worldwide – with the end-to-end security enterprise needs. \n\nBBM Enterprise allows users to take advantage of the speed, reliability and privacy of BBM for faster communication, collaboration and decision making while providing security conscious organizations enhanced security over corporate data.\nBBM Enterprise is the ideal business communication tool because it is mobile and immediate. Unlike enterprise IM tools that were originally designed for use on the desktop, BBM Enterprise offers a truly mobile experience, on a variety of devices.\nWith BBM Enterprise, you only need one app to cover your mobile messaging and collaboration needs. Users know when their colleagues have received and read messages, so they can collaborate with confidence, in real-time. One-to-one chats, group discussions and file sharing all happen with the protection required by security-focused organizations – and all with an immediacy and accountability that’s hard to achieve through any other communication channel. \n\nBBM Enterprise uses a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic library and leverages BlackBerry’s secure infrastructure, trusted by security-conscious and regulated organizations around the world, to protect data while it’s in transit and at rest.  All the added security offered by BBM Enterprise happens in the background, so there’s no impact on the BBM user experience.",

			"description": "Train smarter and get better with The Official Bat Sensor Technology of Major League Baseball®.** Simply attach the Blast Baseball sensor (separate purchase required - available from blastmotion.com or mlb.com/shop) to any standard bat and your iPad or iPhone / Apple Watch will do the rest. Record video of your swings in the Blast Baseball app* and the patented Smart Video Capture ™ technology will automatically identify your swings, clip your video, and overlay your swing metrics, synchronized at impact. (Bat Speed, Time to Contact, Attack Angle, Blast Factor, etc.) With the 3D Swing Tracer, you can replay and analyze your swing path and swing metrics instantly. Live mode provides real-time feedback, allowing you to visualize your swing, make adjustments, and see the results. Compare your swing videos side-by-side or send them to a coach for further analysis.\n \nApple Watch* support allows athletes and coaches to get real-time swing metrics or video highlights displayed on their wrist during practice, while Siri provides real-time voice announcements without requiring users to access their mobile device. The Apple Watch integration also features Apple Health support, allowing athletes and coaches to track important training session data, including heart rate and calorie burn, which can be reviewed on the Apple Watch or in the Apple Health App.\n \nThe Blast Baseball sensor is a highly accurate, advanced 3D motion capture system that records your swings and easily attaches to the end of any regulation bat with the Blast bat attachment.  It uses Bluetooth® Smart technology to connect to your iPhone or iPad.  There’s no need to alter your natural swing and there are no power buttons or controls to get in your way.  The Blast baseball sensor knows when to dynamically power-up the patented motion detection algorithms to capture your metrics in real-time.  It even stores data on the sensor when your mobile device is out of range and downloads your actions to the Blast app as soon as you reconnect.\n \nWith the Blast Baseball app* coaches, parents, and players of all ages can gain the insights they need to improve their performance and gain the competitive edge.\n \n* The Blast Baseball app / Apple Watch app requires the Blast Baseball sensor and the Blast bat attachment to collect data. The app currently supports English language and Imperial measurements.\n** Major League Baseball trademarks and copyrights are used with permission of MLB Advanced Media, L.P. All rights reserved.",

			"releaseNotes": "New in Version 4.0.1:\n\n• Correction of minor errors\n\nNew since version 4.0.0:\n\n• Your Sparkasse App now supports multi-banking and allows you to set up additional accounts at other Sparkassen or banks as long as you have set up at least one Sparkasse account. From now on, you can display all your accounts in a single app! The only requirement is that your accounts are provisioned via the FinTS/HBCI standard, which is used by all Sparkassen as well as most banks.\n• As of this version, your Sparkasse App is \"universal\" and can be used on your smartphone and/or on your tablet. All the familiar features, with the exception of Kwitt, are now at your disposal on your tablet. Support for Kwitt on tablets is forthcoming.\n• Siri can now use Kwitt. Just say, \"Hey, Siri, send money to John Doe with Sparkasse.\"\n• Kwitt groups can now be seen and used by other registered contacts.\n• It's now possible to request money in different amounts from contacts in Kwitt groups.\n• The layout and usability of Kwitt have been improved along with many small tweaks to functionality.\n• The more modern design that was introduced in version 3.0 has been extended to other areas of the app. Alongside many large and small changes, we want to highlight the following topics:\n   - The account setup process has been improved for all Sparkassen so that you can find your financial institution even faster. Quick tip: Shaking the device during setup selects or deselects accounts.\n   - The settings are now grouped and tidier as a result, which means you can configure the Sparkasse App according to your preferences much more easily.\n   - The branch and ATM locator has been completely revamped. It now works faster and more reliably.\n   - You can now swipe through the accounts in your portfolios as easily as you can in the financial overview.\n   - The account and transaction details have been cleaned up, and all fields can be copied to the clipboard with a long press. If the app detects an IBAN on the clipboard, it will ask you whether you want to copy it into the transfer form.\n• And your banking app supports the amazing display on the new iPhone X — including Face ID.\n• In the account details you'll now find the new \"Amount Available\" for each account.\n• Transfers and templates are even easier to create with the improved auto-complete feature. If you start to enter a recipient's name in the transfer screen, you'll get an even better search result for your saved transactions. At the same time, the app offers you direct access to saved templates.\n• The intelligent account assistant automatically recognizes new or inactive accounts as well as changes to names of account holders or account descriptions and asks whether you want to import these changes immediately.\n• New banking supervision requirements for the securities market as part of the MiFid II don't stop at your Sparkasse App: Version 4.0 meets the new MiFid II requirements.\n• In the main menu, the \"Service Center\" entry now takes you to the website for your Sparkasse with direct access to services such as exemption orders, the ability to change your address and much more.\n• Your banking app asks you to review our effort in the App Store. But only when you want to, because this feature can be deactivated in the iOS system settings. However, we welcome any and all of your feedback and would like to take this opportunity to say thanks!",

Get rewards. bthere is a free iPhone app that combines private group location sharing + chat with an awesome rewards program. bthere is the best way for friends to stay in the loop, while earning rewards for just hanging out.\n\nWhat’s New in Version 2.0:\n\n- bthere is introducing a new scoring feature that rewards friends for spending time together. Earn points individually and as a group when you and your friends are within 50 feet of each other. Points can be redeemed individually for local deals and special map pins, and circles with high group scores can win festival tickets and special prizes. \n- Let everyone in your private circle know where the party is happening with bthere’s new “Drop a Piñata” feature. Create meetups, favorite places and more by dropping a piñata. Get notified when friends in your circle arrive or leave a piñata, and earn 2X or 3X the points when your friends are within 50 feet of a piñata.\n\nApp Key Features:\n\n- Geolocation tracking within chosen groups of friends, called “circles.” \n- Create permanent private circles or temporary, 24-hour circles, with settings to modify your location permissions.\n- Never miss out on earning points with bthere’s proximity-based rewards program that allows you and your friends to automatically earn points just by being within 50 feet of each other.\n- Let everyone in your circle know where the party is happening with bthere’s new “Drop a Piñata” feature, and earn 2X or 3X the points when your friends are within 50 feet of a piñata. \n- View friends’ battery life status within your circles. \n- In-app messaging, with the ability to send images, gifs, and reactions to friends' messages.\n- A “Come Get Me” button for urgent situations that notifies everyone in a specific circle.\n- Ability to customize your pin on the map to a custom character.\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. But don’t worry - we’ve refined our application to minimize the impact!",

When you've studied the set amount of time, you get an alert letting you know it's time to take a break. That means it's also great for those who study too long and forget to take breaks at regular intervals.\n\nStudyBreak automatically tracks your study-break intervals so you don't have to. Maybe you want to work for longer than the set time? Or cut one of your breaks short? Just hit the timer button and StudyBreak will tally the extra break time so you can take a longer break later.\n\nExtra features include:\n\n- Background Mode. App works just as well in the background, so all you have to think about is getting work done.\n\n- Today Widget. Start or stop study sessions right from your lock screen.\n\n- Apple Watch App. If you have an Apple Watch, the Watch app is a great companion because it means you can use the app and only touch your phone when you're on a break.\n\n- Stats page to keep track of how efficiently you study and how many hours you study daily\n\n- Colourful timers indicating how efficient your study time is. Green if you meet your goals & red if you don't.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES:\n\n- Reminders. Set alarms to remind you when to start studying or to let you know if you won't complete your study goals for the day by a given time.\n\n- Export data.  Export your data as a csv file so you can graph it or statistically analyse it, in order to get the best out of your study time\n\nGo on, allow studyBreak to help you stay focused and better achieve your study goals!\n\n**Please note that this app contains In App Purchases, including three auto-renewing subscriptions of various lengths; monthly (£0.49), quarterly (£0.99) and annual (£1.49). Each subscription offers the following features for its entire duration:\n\n- Unlimited notifications\n- Study reminders\n- Full access to all statistics\n\nAs with all auto-renewing subscriptions, subscription will continue to automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payment is charged to iTunes Account at the confirmation of purchase and charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n\nAdditionally, there is a one off purchase option that provides unlimited access to all the above features indefinitely. Also note that any purchase will remove ads indefinitely, even if it is a subscription that consequently expires.\n\nPrivacy policy - http://kenechilearnscode.com/studybreakprivacypolicy.pdf\n\nTerms of use - \nhttp://www.kenechilearnscode.com/studybreak_terms_of_use.pdf",
